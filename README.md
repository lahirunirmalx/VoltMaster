# **DIY Digital Voltmeter (DVM) Using Off-the-Shelf Components**  

## **Abstract**  

### **Introduction**  
A **Digital Voltmeter (DVM)** is an essential tool for any electronics hobbyist, engineer, or technician.

# **Part List**

## **Update - 1**

Due to unexpected performance issues with the 16-bit High-Resolution ADC powered by the INA228, the project will now utilize the ADS1256 24-bit DAM for analog-to-digital conversion. This change aims to deliver enhanced measurement resolution and reliability. In addition, a new divider network configuration has been implemented using both 1:10 and 1:1 resistor networks, paired with OPA2333 low-noise op-amps for superior signal conditioning. These updates are expected to improve the overall accuracy and stability of the voltmeter measurements.

## **Update - 2**
Basic voltage measurement has been successfully implemented, and a new attenuation front-end has been added.

The design has been updated to include two displays: a single-row, 10-digit hexadecimal display for voltage readings, and a 20-digit pixel-based display for menu interactions and mathematical functions.

A new 4x3 keypad and rotary encoder have also been added for improved menu navigation.
